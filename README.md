# Local dev
```sh
yarn dev         # interactive/auto-reloads at localhost:3000
yarn build       # build
yarn start       # serve built artifacts locally
yarn export      # export files (to `out/` per firebase.json) for static hosting 

firebase serve   # hosting at localhost:5002
firebase deploy  # hotfix on live
```
